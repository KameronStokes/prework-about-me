      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Im learning how to code through UTSA boot camp</p>
      <h1>Im from Los Angeles California</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Los Angeles California and moved to Texas when i was young.
        I have been interested in coding for a while now teaching myself small things, and 
        briefly going to college for it.</p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies are games, going out to eat, watching movies</h1>
      <p>I dont play as many games lateley can never find the time. I love to eat good food, so im always trying to 
         find something new. Movies are a great pass time, I usually go for intellectual type movies but anything good will do.</p>
      <h1>My dream job would be to work for a start up with success in their future, or maybe a big company like oracle.</h1>
      <p>Im not sure what my strengths are in coding yet, im still learning what type of coding I love to do the most.</p>
      <h1>I currently live in San Antonio Texas!</h1>
      <p>La Cantera in San Antonio is the area I Live in, there are lots of things to do around here.</p>
      <h1>I want to be a web developer because I love problem solving.</h1>
      <p>Nothing feels better than getting code that wasnt working to finally do what it was supposed to do.
        Its like the ultimate puzzle, and you get paid to do it, couldnt ask for more.
